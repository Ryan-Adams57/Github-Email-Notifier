Automating daily email reports in Python can be done using the smtplib library for sending emails and schedule for scheduling tasks. Below, I’ll provide a sample script and walk you through the setup.

Step 1: Install Required Packages.
You need to install the schedule library if you don't have it yet. You can do this via pip:

pip install schedule

Step 2: Create the Email Script.

Here’s a basic script that sends a daily email report:

import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
import schedule
import time

def send_email_report():
    # Email configuration
    sender_email = "your_email@example.com"
    receiver_email = "recipient@example.com"
    subject = "Daily Report"
    body = "This is your daily report."

    # Create the email
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = receiver_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Connect to the SMTP server
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587)  # Use the SMTP server of your email provider
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, 'your_password')  # Use your email password
        server.send_message(msg)
        print("Email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")
    finally:
        server.quit()

# Schedule the email to be sent every day at 8 AM
schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(send_email_report)

# Keep the script running
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)


Step 3: Modify the Script.

Update Email Configuration: Replace your_email@example.com, recipient@example.com, and smtp.example.com with your actual email address, the recipient's address, and your email provider's SMTP server.
Login Credentials: Replace 'your_password' with the actual password of your email account. For security reasons, consider using an application-specific password if your email provider supports it.
Email Content: Modify the subject and body variables as per your reporting requirements.

Step 4: Running the Script
Save the Script: Save the code to a file, for example, daily_email_report.py.

Run the Script: Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the script:

python daily_email_report.py

Keep it Running: Make sure your script keeps running. You can use tools like screen or tmux on Linux, or run it in the background on Windows.

Step 5: Automate Script Execution (Optional)

If you want to run this script automatically without keeping a terminal open, you can schedule it using a task scheduler.

Windows: Use Task Scheduler to create a new task that runs the script at startup or on a schedule.

Linux: Use cron to schedule the script. Edit your crontab by running crontab -e and add a line like this to run it at 8 AM:

@reboot /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/daily_email_report.py

Security Considerations

Credentials: Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file.

Email Limits: Check your email provider’s sending limits to avoid being temporarily blocked.

Final Note

Feel free to expand the functionality of the email body, such as attaching files, generating dynamic content, or pulling data from a database.
